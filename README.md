> NB: Week 13 is the week of Thanksgiving, there is only a Monday meeting.

### 1. A Quick Review of functions in the `String` Module

We reviewed `String.length`, `String.sub` and `String.index`.  All of these functions would be useful in a solution to problem set 9.

### 2. The Needleman-Wunsch Sequence Alignment Algorithm

The [Needleman-Wunsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needleman%E2%80%93Wunsch_algorithm) Alignment Algorithm is summarized in the accompanying powerpoint slides.
